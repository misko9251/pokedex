A fun project I built to embrace my inner 90's with HTML/CSS/JS and the PokeAPI.

I had a lot of fun with this project as I got to dive deep into the vast PokeAPI. 

It was a great experience to work with the expansive list of information that this API has to offer.

I particularly enjoyed creating the button that makes the Pokemon 'shiny'. It was interesting to grab the pokemon value, have it already stored, and then fire the function to turn the Pokemon shiny.
